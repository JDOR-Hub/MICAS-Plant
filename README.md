# Measurement, Instrumentation, Control, and Automatization System for Plant's Health

## Description
This project proposes the development of an autonomous system for plant health monitoring, integrating measurement, instrumentation, and control systems using the ESP32 microcontroller. The system will monitor key agricultural parameters such as soil moisture, ambient temperature, humidity, water levels, solar radiation, and soil nutrients through a variety of sensors. Data will be transmitted using MQTT protocol to a graphical user interface (GUI) for real-time monitoring and control. Actuators, including servomotors and water pumps, will automate tasks like irrigation, fertilizer deployment and solar panel positioning. The system is designed to provide alerts when critical conditions are detected.
